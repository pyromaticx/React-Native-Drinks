React Native Drinks

This is a quick React Native app I built to help me study house drinks for Roots and Rye. If you are in Santana Row, San Jose, CA come by and say whats up!

Currently only built for android, bc I dont have an apple to build on, or an iPhone. Android FTW!

*Todo: Add images, breathalyzer, uber api and get out of jail free card.
